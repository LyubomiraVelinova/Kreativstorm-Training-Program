'''
Write a program that prompts the user for a string
and checks whether the string is a palindrome (i.e., the string reads the same forward and backward).
'''

# def is_palindrome(text: str):
#     return text == text[::-1]
#
#
# user_input = input("Enter a string: ")
#
# print(is_palindrome(user_input))

'''
Write a program that takes in a list of integers 
and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.
'''


# def get_even_numbers(numbers: list):
#     even_nums = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
#     return sum(even_nums)
#
#
# print(get_even_numbers([2, 4, 7, 8]))

'''
Write a program that prompts the user for their age 
and checks whether they are old enough to vote (i.e., 18 years old or older).
'''

# age = input("Enter your age: ")
# try:
#     age = int(age)
#     if age >= 18:
#         print('You are old enough to vote.')
#     else:
#         print('You are not old enough to vote.')
# except ValueError:
#     print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age as a number.")
